- What are the main **error sources**?

<details><summary><b>Answer: </b></summary>

#### How can positioning systems be **classified**?
Positioning systems can be classified in the following categories:
- **physical**/**symbolic** systems:
- **absolute**/**relative** systems:
- **centralized**/**decentralized** systems:

Other factors:
- **accuracy**;
- **precision**;
- **privacy**;
- **scalability**;
- **technology costraints** and **costs**;

#### What are the **basic techniques** to calculate devices distance?
**Lateration**

There are different ways to calculate the distance:
- Based on **signal propagation**.
- Based on **signal strength**.

**Time Difference of Arrival**

**Angulation**

**Proximity**

**Scene Analysis**

#### What are the main **error sources**?
The most common error sources are the following:
- non line of sight (**NLoS**);
- **shadowing** and **multipath** fading;
- **clock skew**, which is due to wrong clock synchronization;
