## 0 - Introduction


Qualcosa su IEEE

A middleware is the enabling factor/technology without which it would be impossible to develop on top of a mobile device.
Smartphones are not the only mobile systems:
- **vehicles**: they're even more connected one by the other and have some more critical constraints. E.g. two cars need to exchange information just when passing one next to the other. Wi-Fi wouldn't be the best choice in that use case, since it requires too much time to be spent for the association and connection initialization;
- **IoT devices**: they exploit communication enriched with additional data and information coming from sensors;
- **edge/fog computing**: possibility to have some computing machine close to the IoT device.

#### Mobile Computing
Mobile computing requires an approach at **multiple layers** and with **multiple competences/skills**:
- embedded devices (miniaturization, pocket-sized, handheld, ...);
- wireless communications (many, differentiated and heterogeneous);
- software support platforms (OS, middlewares, frameworks, libraries, ...);
- energy management at software level;
- contex management;
- cross-layer management of application requirements and resource allocation;
- support to infrastructure-based serviecs;
- support to mobile peer-to-peer, opportunistic, and delay-tolerant services;
- support to mobile social-aware services;
- support to mobile-fog-cloud integrated services in an efficient and smart way;
